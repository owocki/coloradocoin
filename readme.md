UPDATE - 2018/02 - [Read about ColoradoCoin at ETHDenver](https://medium.com/gitcoin/colorado-coin-2fd9a52a88b6)

# Colorado Coin (COLO) - [A SolidCoin](http://solidcoin.co/)

An experimental ERC20 token for organizating local communities.  Dogfooded at [Boulder Blockchain](https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Blockchain/) (and hopefully more Colorad-based meetups soon!)

Credit for the idea goes to [Paul Foley](http://paulnicholasfoley.com/), [Rhys Lindmark](https://twitter.com/RhysLindmark), [Kevin Seagraves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinseagraves).  This concept is meant to be by & for the community, and this repo is just one of the many possible implementations of it.   Hat tip [Jonathan Palmer](https://twitter.com/redzebra) for helping with laser cutting / printing.

# How it works.

ColoradoCoins can be physically created by 

1. printing the above image.
2. `mint()`ing some coins (see below) and placing them into a [YouveGotETH](https://youvegoteth.github.io) QR Code.
3. physically affixing the ColoradoCoin image to the sticker printed in #1.

The QR Code that represents the private key (and a small amount of ETH for transfering them) via a [YouveGotETH](https://youvegoteth.github.io) link.

Here's what they look like:

I'm aware the build quality needs improvement.  This is a v0.  (If you know anyone who could up the build quality, please [contact me on twitter](http://twitter.com/owocki)).

Anywho, here's what the 'receive' interface looks like:

# Token Distribution

Right now, there are 1200 tokens on the mainnet.  

The tokens distribution as follows is:

* 1200 tokens: ETHDenver hackathon

## Process for minting new tokens

As tokens are minted, this read me will be updated.  If you're not the trusting type (and hey, you shouldn't be since we're in a trustless ecosystem), check the deployed contracts above for "mint" events or "mint" transactions.


## Token Distribution Changelog

* 02/15/2018 - Minted 1200 tokens for ETHDenver.com.
* 12/28/2017 - Minted 300 tokens for demo purposes.
* 9/4/2017 - Minted 100 tokens for demo purposes.
